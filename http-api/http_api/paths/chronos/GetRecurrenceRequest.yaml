    description: >
      Looks up details for a specific recurrence from an event series. This includes the series master, as well as the recurrence event,
      along with information whether it is an overridden and/or re-scheduled occurrence compared to the regular series.
      <p/>
      This can either be performed for an event series identifier along with the targeted recurrence id, or for an already overridden
      instance.
